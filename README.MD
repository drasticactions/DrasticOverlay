**This requires MAUI Preview 11+**

This repo contains some examples of MAUI `IWindowOverlay` implementations. While its primary use is for the `VisualDiagnostics` layer on `Window`, it can be used for much more.

I've written some examples of how you can use `IWindowOverlay` to create custom UI to show both in the foreground and background of your apps. Play around with it and have fun!
